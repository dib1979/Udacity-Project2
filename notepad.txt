Operationalizing ML Model
We will use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. We will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline

1.We start our project by getting bank marketing dataset registerd - Refer to Screenshot
2.We start the AutoML experiment - Classification task
3.Once Run is completed we choose the Best Model - Refer to Screenshot
4.Deploy the Best Model using ACI & Enabling Authntication - Refer to Screenshot of the endpoint
5.Copy the config.json file and make changes in the logs.py file.
6.Finally execute the logs.py file - - Refer to Screenshot
7.Application insight is enabled - Refer to Screenshot
8.Copy swagger.json file to swagger folder and make changes to the swagger .sh [port changed from default #80 to 9000] file.
9.Execute the swagger.sh file & login to http://localhost:9000 - Refer to Screenshot
10.Execute the serve.py file & in search bar http://localhost:8000/swagger.json - Refer to Screenshot
11.Display the JSON payload - Refer to Screenshot
12.Go to endpoint.py file and make changes to Rest url and primary key - Refer to Screenshot
13.Execute the endpoint.py file to show the Output - Refer to Screenshot
14.data.json file gets created - Refer to Screenshot
15.Make changes to benchmark.sh file & execute the file which calls cb - Refer to Screenshot

Load the Notebook
1.Import necessary libraries, Workspace, Experiment , Compute cluster & dataset is loaded as pandas data frames
2.Initialize the AutoML settings
3.Now we create the pipeline for which we prepare the pipeline data by defining the name for the best model and location for our datastore
4.Now we create the autoML step by calling the autoMLconfig
5.Finally we create a pipeline by calling the autoML step & Then we submit the pipeline - Refer to Screenshot
6.We then publish the pipeline and enable authentication locally, We need the REST url which would be contained in the pipeline_endpoint object.
7.HTTP post request is created using the endpoint URL, authentication header and the JSON file - Refer to Screenshot
8.The “Published Pipeline overview”, showing a REST endpoint and a status of ACTIVE. It can be found under
Endpoints > Pipeline Endpoints  - Refer to Screenshot
9.The Bankmarketing dataset with the AutoML module. It can be found under:
Piplelines > Bankmarketing Train  - Refer to Screenshot
