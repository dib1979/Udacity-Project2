# Operationalizing Machine Learning
### **Overview**
In this project, we will continue to work with the Bank Marketing dataset. We will use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. We will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline. In the end, we will demonstrate all of our work by creating a README file and a screencast video.
### **Project main steps**
In this project, we will following the below steps:
1.	Authentication
2.	Automated ML Experiment
3.	Deploy the best model
4.	Enable logging
5.	Swagger Documentation
6.	Consume model endpoints
7.	Create and publish a pipeline
8.	Documentation

# Create and run Auto ML Experiment
Dataset has been, created with the name “project2-demo”
